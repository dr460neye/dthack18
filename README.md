## What is it about?
How can WiFi device data be used sensibly for life in the city of the future? Whether developer or designer - we are looking for you! **The winner will receive 1,000 euros, the second-placed 500 euros and the third-placed 250 euros**.   

This 24-hour hackathon (13.09.2018, 09:00 â€“ 14.09.2018, 13:00) is all about how mobility data from citizens in cities can be collected and used to optimize life on public roads. Here we are talking about real cases of cities that can already be used tomorrow with your help.  

We are looking for interested developers and designers who would like to work together on defined challenges. The results will be presented directly in the following week (17.09.) to invited city representatives, mayors, designers.  

The challenges at a glance:
* **Challenge 1**: How can public transport companies (bus and train) use WiFi monitoring to measure the mobility flow of their passengers (KPI: how many people in the car, length of stay, transfer passengers, line, location, in/out)?
* **Challenge 2**: How can the city use WiFi monitoring to measure traffic flow and optimize planning (KPI: pedestrian, bicycle, car)?
* **Challenge 3**: How can motion flows be visualized based on WiFi positioning of smartphones and made usable for urban planning (KPI: map heatmap, dwell time on site)?
* **Challenge 4**: How can mesh networks support data transfer between the sensor nodes (KPI: n sensor nodes with high data throughput in a mesh network - but only one node with cloud connection)?  

Are you ready for these challenges? Then secure now one of the limited places for the first and best trackathon of all time!  

Deadline for registration: **Sunday, 09 September 2018**

Participation and meals (food and drink) are free of charge. Arrival is at your own expense.
